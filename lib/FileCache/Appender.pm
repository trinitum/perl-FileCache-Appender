=head1 VERSION

    use FileCache::Appender;
    # returns cached file handle, or opens file for appending
    my $fh = FileCache::Appender->file($path);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

cache.

=cut

sub new {
    my ( $class, %args ) = @_;
    $args{_fd_cache}   = {};
    $args{_open_count} = 0;
    $args{max_open} ||= 512;
    return bless \%args, $class;
}

=head2 $self->file($path)

returns file handle for the file specified by I<$path>. If file handle for the
file is not in the cache, will open file for appending and cache file handle.

=cut

sub file {
    my ( $self, $path ) = @_;
    unless ( ref $self ) {
        $self = $global //= $self->new;
    }
    my $cache = $self->{_fd_cache};
    unless ( $cache->{$path} ) {
        if ( $self->{_open_count} == $self->{max_open} ) {
            delete $cache->{ ( keys %$cache )[ rand $self->{_open_count}-- ] };
        }
        open my $fd, ">>", $path or croak "Couldn't open $path: $!";
        $self->{_open_count}++;
        $cache->{$path} = $fd;
    }
    return $cache->{$path};
}
